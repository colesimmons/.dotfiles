git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/colesimmons/.dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles;
./install.sh
./install-packages.sh
./system-config.sh

cd oh-my-fish
bin/install --offline
omf install boxfish
```


Things I had to do:
* oh-my-fish didn't install
* iTerm
  * Install nord theme (https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/blob/master/schemes/nord.itermcolors)
  * Change to "compact"
  * Install Hack iCursive S12
* Disable notifications
* Set Firefox settings, install extensions (uBlock, Redux, Dashlane)
* Log in to Mullvad
* Set up f.lux
* Install BetterSnapTool, Pages, Numbers from app store
* Config BetterSnapTool (done?)
* Turn off alert sounds
* Install google cloud proxy
* Turn off "Displays have separate spaces" in Mission Control so that toolbar only shows on one
